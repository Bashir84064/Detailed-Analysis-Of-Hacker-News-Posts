# Detailed-Analysis-Of-Hacker-News-Posts
This project is all about analyzing the content user share in Hacker news which is a reddit for technology.  The data set is obtained from keggle and it contains 20,000 rows after deleting the posts with no comments and randomly sampling from the remaining rows.  Certain information like id,title ,url ,user who submittedm,the number of comments,number of points and timestamp of creation about posts are present. We are interested in analyzing two types of posts  
1. Ask HN (user asks the hacker news community a certain technology related question) 
2. Show HN (user wants to sow some interesting project/news to hacker news community)
